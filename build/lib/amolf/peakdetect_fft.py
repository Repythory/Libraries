    """
    Performs a FFT calculation on the data and zero-pads the results to
    increase the time domain resolution after performing the inverse fft and
    send the data to the 'peakdetect' function for peak 
    detection.
    
    Omitting the x_axis is forbidden as it would make the resulting x_axis
    value silly if it was returned as the index 50.234 or similar.
    
    Will find at least 1 less peak then the 'peakdetect_zero_crossing'
    function, but should result in a more precise value of the peak as
    resolution has been increased. Some peaks are lost in an attempt to
    minimize spectral leakage by calculating the fft between two zero
    crossings for n amount of signal periods.
    
    The biggest time eater in this function is the ifft and thereafter it's
    the 'peakdetect' function which takes only half the time of the ifft.
    Speed improvementd could include to check if 2**n points could be used for
    fft and ifft or change the 'peakdetect' to the 'peakdetect_zero_crossing',
    which is maybe 10 times faster than 'peakdetct'. The pro of 'peakdetect'
    is that it resutls in one less lost peak. It should also be noted that the
    time used by the ifft function can change greatly depending on the input.
    
    keyword arguments:
    y_axis -- A list containg the signal over which to find peaks
    x_axis -- A x-axis whose values correspond to the y_axis list and is used
        in the return to specify the postion of the peaks.
    pad_len -- (optional) By how many times the time resolution should be
        increased by, e.g. 1 doubles the resolution. The amount is rounded up
        to the nearest 2 ** n amount (default: 5)
    
    return -- two lists [max_peaks, min_peaks] containing the positive and
        negative peaks respectively. Each cell of the lists contains a tupple
        of: (position, peak_value) 
        to get the average peak value do: np.mean(max_peaks, 0)[1] on the
        results to unpack one of the lists into x, y coordinates do: 
        x, y = zip(*tab)
