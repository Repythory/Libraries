    """
    Function for detecting local maximas and minmias in a signal.
    Discovers peaks by dividing the signal into bins and retrieving the
    maximum and minimum value of each the even and odd bins respectively.
    Division into bins is performed by smoothing the curve and finding the
    zero crossings.
    
    Suitable for repeatable signals, where some noise is tolerated. Excecutes
    faster than 'peakdetect', although this function will break if the offset
    of the signal is too large. It should also be noted that the first and
    last peak will probably not be found, as this function only can find peaks
    between the first and last zero crossing.
    
    keyword arguments:
    y_axis -- A list containg the signal over which to find peaks
    x_axis -- (optional) A x-axis whose values correspond to the y_axis list
        and is used in the return to specify the postion of the peaks. If
        omitted an index of the y_axis is used. (default: None)
    window -- the dimension of the smoothing window; should be an odd integer
        (default: 11)
    
    return -- two lists [max_peaks, min_peaks] containing the positive and
        negative peaks respectively. Each cell of the lists contains a tupple
        of: (position, peak_value) 
        to get the average peak value do: np.mean(max_peaks, 0)[1] on the
        results to unpack one of the lists into x, y coordinates do: 
        x, y = zip(*tab)
