    """
    Function for detecting local maximas and minmias in a signal.
    Discovers peaks by fitting the model function: y = k (x - tau) ** 2 + m
    to the peaks. The amount of points used in the fitting is set by the
    points argument.
    
    Omitting the x_axis is forbidden as it would make the resulting x_axis
    value silly if it was returned as index 50.234 or similar.
    
    will find the same amount of peaks as the 'peakdetect_zero_crossing'
    function, but might result in a more precise value of the peak.
    
    keyword arguments:
    y_axis -- A list containg the signal over which to find peaks
    x_axis -- A x-axis whose values correspond to the y_axis list and is used
        in the return to specify the postion of the peaks.
    points -- (optional) How many points around the peak should be used during
        curve fitting, must be odd (default: 9)
    
    return -- two lists [max_peaks, min_peaks] containing the positive and
        negative peaks respectively. Each cell of the lists contains a list
        of: (position, peak_value) 
        to get the average peak value do: np.mean(max_peaks, 0)[1] on the
        results to unpack one of the lists into x, y coordinates do: 
        x, y = zip(*max_peaks)
